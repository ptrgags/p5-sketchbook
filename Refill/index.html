          You have before you a set of meters that drain over time. You can
          click a meter to refill it. If a meter is left empty, its color will
          become more red to represent being behind. You can fix this by
          over-filling the meter (though this takes a few clicks). If you leave
          a meter empty for too long though, the meter will break and you can't
          recover from this.
        </p>
        <p>
          This interactive experience is intentionally impossible. There's too
          many meters, it would take too long to click all of them. And even if
          you could be fast enough, eventually fatigue or boredom will get in
          the way of maintaining things forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          This experience was inspired by the endless onslaught of things one
          has to do in every day life. Buy food, do the dishes, do the laundry,
          etc. It's a lot, and it can feel overwhelming at times.
        </p>

          What is one to do? There's plenty of strategies, albeit most go beyond
          the scope of this toy model:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Prioritize. For one person, it's impossible to fill <em>all</em> the
            meters, but you can fill some of them (for a long while at least).
          </li>
          <li>
            Rely on others. Maybe you have friends or family to help share
            chores. Maybe you use services (e.g. food delivery, landscaping) to
            help with things you don't have time for. This makes it possible to
            fill multiple meters at once.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use tools. E.g. a microwave makes meal prep easier and faster, where
            applicable. This is like filling the meters faster and/or more per
            click.
