          Raster Tangles is an algorithm for making geometric art by repeatly
          subdividing an image with various patterns. This was inspired by the
          doodles I draw on paper.

          This was the original version of Raster Tangles I made back in 2022.
          Later in 2024-2025, I made an improved version of the algorithm that
          adds clearer outlines between regions. You can find that in my

          in that repo, as it has plenty of illustrations of how the algorithm
          works.
