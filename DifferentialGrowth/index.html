          This sketch is a simulation of differential growth. This is a pattern
          of organic growth you find in everything from plants to the brain.
          When the boundary of an organism grows rapidly, the internal forces
          cause it to fold up on itself to better fit the surrounding space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each "organism" is represented here by a polygon. The organism's
          boundary has many "boundary cells", represented as the vertices of the
          polygon. Each cell can move around independently, subject to several
          rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If cells get too close together, they experience a repulsion force.
            This both helps the organism avoid intersecting itself, as well as
            other organisms it encounters.
          </li>
          <li>
            cells pull on their 2 connected neighbors. If a cell strays from its
            neighbors, it will experience tension that pulls it back like a
            spring.
          </li>
          <li>
            Periodically, a new cell is grown at a random spot on the organism's
            boundary
          </li>
          <li>
            If an edge of the polygon becomes too long, a new cell is grown at
            the midpoint, as if easing the strain on the organism
          </li>
          <li>
            If the angle between adjacent edges becomes too small, a new cell is
            grown in an attempt to keep the curve round.
          </li>
          <li>
            In this particular simulation, I clamp the vertices so the shape
            doesn't go off-screen.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This implementation still isn't quite right. For example, once space
          becomes limited, the curves start self-intersecting. I'm not sure how
          to detect this, let alone how to avoid it.

          This sketch was started in 2021 (see the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/ptrgags/p5-sketchbook/blob/main/DifferentialGrowth/logbook.md"
            >logbook</a
          >
          for the full history). I stopped after a while since I wasn't happy
          with the results. I returned to it in 2025 and cleaned it up to make
          what you see above. I used
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline">B-splines</a>
          to smooth out the polylines into curves, which greatly improves the
          look. I also adjusted the simulation so the curves grow faster.
