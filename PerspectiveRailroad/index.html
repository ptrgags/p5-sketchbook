          This animation draws inspiration from both math and art. I recently
          read
          <a
            href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/YQ3jDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&kptab=overview"
            >Perspective Made Easy</a
          >
          by Ernest R. Norling. The book is a handy tutorial on drawing in
          perspective in traditional art. A couple of constructions were helpful
          here. First, the method to draw evenly-spaced fence posts is useful
          for spacing the bottom of each railroad tie. I also used the method to
          divide a perspective rectangle into even sub-divisions. This was
          useful for giving the railroad ties thickness.

          I've also been exploring
          <a href="https://bivector.net/index.html">Geometric Algebra</a>, and
          found that
          <a href="https://bivector.net/PGA4CS.html"
            >2D Plane-based Geometric Algebra (PGA)</a

          is perfect for perspective drawings like this. It allows you to "join"
          two points into a line, or "meet" two lines to find the point of
          intersection. This is much like drawing with a straightedge on paper.
