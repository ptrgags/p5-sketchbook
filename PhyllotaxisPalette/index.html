          While thinking about the math of sunflower spirals (see the
          <a href="../InfiniteSunflower/">Infinite Sunflower sketch</a>), I
          realized a possible use for this pattern. If the spiral is
          superimposed on the HSV color wheel (with value = 1), then every point
          corresponds to a unique color! And each successive color will be a
          different hue compared with the previous one.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, that produces a washed-out color palette since there are many
          small points near the origin (white). Applying a square root to the
          saturation compensates for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          This palette is but one of many possibilities. HSV is a 3D color
          space, and the points trace out a 1D spiral, so it's only possible to
          pick out a small sampling of colors at a time. Since I usually use a
          dark background, I kept the value at a maximum for good contrast.
          However, in other situations, a palette that tends towards grey or
          black might be more helpful.
