          I made this as a generative art experiment that's fun to watch. At
          each time step, pick a node in the tree. A random neighbor is chosen
          (with a chance of skipping) to grow a new branch. If no new branches
          are added, the node becomes a "flower" and blooms after a delay.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is similar to a random depth-first-search (DFS) maze generation
          algorithm, however:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Growth can go upwards and sideways, but not downwards. Furthermore,
            upwards growth is weighted slightly higher.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every several simulation steps, I shuffle the list of unvisited
            nodes so the plant grows more "bushy". a true DFS produces a plant
            that mostly follows a single path.
          </li>
