# Processing Sketchbook (2016, 2021, 2024)

Repo for storing my one-shot Processing/p5.js sketches in one place.

This is still under construction. Over the years I've made plenty of sketches
scattered across several devices. I plan to gather them up here in time.

**NOTE**: The contents of this repo are subject to change over time. I may
remove old sketches that are neither interesting nor useful for learning. I
may move sketches into other repos if they are polished enough.
