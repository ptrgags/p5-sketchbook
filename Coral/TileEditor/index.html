          Click and drag the vertices (yellow) and tips of the tangents (green)
          to adjust the shape of the curve!

          Lately I've been studying a coral-shaped motif that appears often in
          my art. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <img src="coral-example.png" alt="example of coral motif" />
        <p>
          I'm working towards modeling this shape with bezier curves in
          quad-shaped tiles. This is the second iteration of the sketch. Here
          I'm exploring a set of 16 tiles representing all the ways quads can
          connect to each other. I traverse the grid in the direction that puts
          the orange lines (indicating where the tiles are connected) to the
          left.
        </p>
        <p>
          To view all 16 possible tiles, I connected them into 4 islands as
          symmetrically as possible. This explains the 4 counter-clockwise
          loops. There are also 4 small clockwise loops due to cycles in the
          connection graph.
