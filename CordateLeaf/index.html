          Animation of a growing leaf with a cordate shape. This is based on a
          diagram in Chapter 5 of The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants by Przemys≈Çaw
          Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer (yes, the Lindenmayer whom
          L-systems are named after!).
        </p>
        <p>
          Essentially the shape of the leaf is a bunch of radial ribs. They all
          move at the same rate, but start growing at different times. The rib
          in the center is the first one which is why the center of the leaf is
          pointy. At constant time intervals, symmetric pairs of ribs are added,
          always a constant angle away from the adjacent rib.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the time delay between the growth of the ribs, you get this
          heart shape. If all the ribs started growing at the same time, it
          would make a circular pattern instead.
