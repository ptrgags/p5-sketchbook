                I made this in college when I was learning about
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">Bézier curves</a> and other splines. There are
                several ways to make a Bézier curve, I chose to use the one
                where you interpolate pairs of control points, then interpolate
                the interpolated points, and so on, until you get a single
                point on the curve. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau%27s_algorithm1">De Casteljau's Algorithm</a>
                but I did not know that until quite a bit later.
