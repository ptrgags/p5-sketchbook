# Music Layout

## 2022-11-06 First Steps

Today I took the JSON output of the corresponding Rust project and visualized
it. I first tried a horizontal layout but that requires a very wide canvas.
A vertical layout is more natural on a screen so I changed to this.

I also highlighted the first time each symbol appears. This will make it
easier to design my composition.
