# Music Layout (2022)

This sketch is intended to be used along with my other repo, `tangle-grammars`.
This sketch just visualizes the results so I can start composing music!

I included a couple example layouts, one is a nested ABBA pattern another
one that takes a grid of 16 cells, numbers them mod 3 (a technique I learned
from the paper on [gTangle](https://pellacini.di.uniroma1.it/publications/gtangle16/gtangle16-paper.pdf))
