          Drag pixels around the canvas to make pixel art! you can use the color
          pickers to change the colors. The Save image buttons downloads the
          pixel art as a PNG image.

          About a year ago, I wanted to make art for my wall. I realized that if
          I used Lego tiles, it would let me make pixel art that's reusable.
          This puts interesting constraints on the pixel art:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The canvas is low resolution, only 16x16 tiles! Here's what that
            would look like if these were screen pixels:
            <img width="16" src="figures/mosaic-tile.png" />
          </li>
          <li>
            The color palette is limited by what color lego tiles I have on
            hand.
          </li>
          <li>
            I also have a limited number of tiles, so I have to be aware of
            <em>number</em> of pixels in each color used in the artwork.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Since counting out pixels sounds like a chore, I realized there was an
          easier way: if I start with the same number of tiles in each color and
          only rearrange them, that will satisfy the constraints. I don't know
          of any drawing program with this kind of tool, so I made this sketch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's an example artwork I made with this sketch, and what it looks
          like in Lego:
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <img
            width="250"
            alt="An example abstract mosaic"
            src="figures/mosaic-example.png"
          />
          <br />
          <img
            width="250"
            alt="The same abstract mosaic made with Lego tiles"
            src="figures/lego-mosaic.jpg"
          />
        </div>
