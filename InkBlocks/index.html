          A silly automaton inspired by fountain pens and sunflowers. Let me
          explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my fountain pen case, I keep 6 fountain pens for journaling and
          drawing so I can always have a variety of colors available.
        </p>
        <p>
          I treat the fountain pen case like a circular buffer. Each day I use a
          pen from the next slot, circling back to the start when I reach the
          end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, a pen runs out of ink. I remove it from the pen case for
          cleaning. The other pens shift over to fill the gap, leaving slots
          open at the right end of the pen case.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I clean and refill pens, I choose a new color to keep things
          interesting, and I add it to one of those slots in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question then is, "If I repeat this process for many months, what
          pattern is produced?". So I made this little automaton to simulate the
          above process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each row of 6 blocks in the above visualization represents the colors
          used in a span of 6 days (one traversal of the fountain pen case). The
          hue represents the ink color, while the decreasing brightness
          represents using up the ink over time. Each successive row is the new
          set of colors after removing empty pens from the middle of the case,
          and adding refilled pens at the end with new colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is the stripey texture you see above. The stripes have a
          slant to them because new pens appear on the right, and shift towards
          the left as pens run out of ink. Furthermore, colors are brightest on
          the right since new pens are at full capacity, and darkest on the left
          because those pens have been used a number of times.
        </p>
        <p>
          What has this to do with sunflowers? I needed a color palette where
          each new entry contrasts the previous few colors. This was around the
          same time I was exploring the math of sunflower spirals. And I
          realized that spiral phyllotaxis would be perfect for this. That's why
          I made <a href="../PhyllotaxisPalette/">Phyllotaxis Palette</a>.
