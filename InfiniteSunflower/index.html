          Recently I've found a few different sources that all mention the
          mathematical pattern of spiral phyllotaxis, the spiral arrangement of
          leaves and petals of various plants.

          The last paper is most relevant here, as it talks not just about how
          the spirals relate to the Fibonacci sequence, but also how the pattern
          develops as the inflorescence grows. It also links to
          <a href="https://youtu.be/dvvJG6P3K_M?si=jG3OHvB5UhLB5zfd"
            >animations of the growth pattern</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          After reading that, I first explored the math of these spirals in
          Desmos and made
          <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9xbb0rrn1c"
            >this interactive graph</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sketch is my artistic interpretation of the above. I create
          florets in the center of the circle, and each moves radially outwards.
          Each successive floret appears one golden angle away from the previous
          one. This is enough to produce the spiral pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          A real sunflower stops growing at a certain point, while my animation
          goes on forever. Also, a real flower would distinguish between petals
          and florets that produce seeds.
