          Recently I've found a few different sources that all mention the
          mathematical pattern of spiral phyllotaxis, the spiral arrangement of
          leaves/petals/primordia of various plants.

          The last article is most relevant here, as it talks not just about how
          the spirals relate to the Fibonacci sequence, but how the pattern
          develops as the inflorescence grows. It also links to
          <a href="https://youtu.be/dvvJG6P3K_M?si=jG3OHvB5UhLB5zfd"
            >animations of the growth pattern</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          After reading that, I first explored the math of these spirals in
          Desmos and made
          <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9xbb0rrn1c"
            >this interactive graph</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, I wanted to do something more artistic, which resulted in this
          sketch. I create primordia in the center of the circle, and each moves
          radially outwards, each spaced a golden angle around the circle
          compared to the previous one. This is enough to produce the spiral
          pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm using plenty of artistic license here. A real sunflower stops
          growing at a certain point, while my animation goes on forever. Also,
          on a real flower, a seed wouldn't turn into a petal like they do here.
