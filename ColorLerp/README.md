# Linearly Interpolating Colors (2016)

I found this old sketch. I'm not sure why it exists, I guess a few years ago
I was still new to the linear interpolation formula. Nowadays, if I need to
make gradients like this, I'd write a shader for this.

I might decide to remove this sketch in the future.
