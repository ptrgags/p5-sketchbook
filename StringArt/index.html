        <p>
          I was looking through some old Processing.py code from my college
          years and found a sketch that looked interesting. I adapted it into
          the nicer form that you see here.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sketch visualizes modular integer arithmetic. Essentially it's
          your usual arithmetic, except wrapped around a circle. If a number is
          larger than the number of points around the circle, you just wrap
          around to 0. It's a lot like a clock or a board game.
        </p>
        <p>
          The visualization is simple. Take each point on the circle. Apply the
          selected math function to the number. Then draw a line between the
          input and output point. One exception is when a number lands on
          itself.In that case, I draw a circle around the point.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is a web of lines that look quite similar to string art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since it's hard to tell which end of the line is the input and which
          is the output, the Animate option animates the transition. More
          importantly, it creates mesmerizing patterns!
