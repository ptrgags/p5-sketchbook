          This sketch visualizes modular integer arithmetic. This is your usual
          addition and multiplication, except wrapped around a circle. If a
          number is larger than the number of points on the circle, you just
          wrap around to 0. It's just like going around the numbers of a clock
          or spaces on a board game.
        </p>
        <p>
          The visualization works as follows: take a point on the circle. Apply
          the selected math function to transform it into a new number. Then
          draw a line between the original and new points. Doing this for all
          points on the circle creates a web structure that looks like string
          art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes a number will land back on itself. In cases like these, a
          circle is drawn around the point to emphasize that it stays in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "Animate" option animates the transition from a number to its
          transformed value. This makes it easier to tell which end of a line is
          which. More importantly, it creates mesmerizing patterns!
        </p>
        <p>
          This sketch was adapted from some old Processing.py code I made back
          in 2017.
