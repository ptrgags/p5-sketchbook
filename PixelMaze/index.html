          Arrow keys or virtual direction pad to explore the maze. That's all
          for now (stay tuned!).

        <p>UPDATE 2025-04-12 - I added a virtual direction pad for mobile</p>
        <p>Notes: (ordered by priority)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            游릭Add an entrance at the bottom of the map, and an exit at the top
          </li>
          <li>
            游릭Add stuff you can interact with to the maze. I'm thinking doors
            and locks.
          </li>
          <li>
            游리Add a run button to make the character animate faster and also
            speed up the position animation
          </li>
          <li>
            游리This sketch laid the foundation for pixel art rendering in my
            sketches. I still need to clean up and test more of the code to be
            reusable
          </li>
          <li>
            游리Profiling things in the performance, drawing the tilemap is enough
            to drop the framerate from 60 to ~53 FPS on desktop. Try rendering
            just the tiles in the viewport, not the whole map. If that's still
            too slow, consider other methods (maybe render to an off-screen
            texture and cache that across frames? the tilemap is mostly static
            unless the viewport moves).
          </li>
          <li>游Try adding easing curves for better in-betweens</li>
          <li>
            游Wall decoration - I have a nicer tileset with brick walls and
            rounded corners, but I'll need to add some code to determine where
            to place the tiles
          </li>
          <li>
            游The tileset also had some trim around where the walls meet the
            ceiling. I realized there's a simpler way to place the corner tiles,
            but I'll have to think through the math a bit
          </li>
          <li>游Make a nicer character sprite.</li>
          <li>
            游ㅁdding a sound effect for when the character runs into a wall
            would be nice for feedback.
