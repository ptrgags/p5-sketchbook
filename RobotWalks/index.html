          Use left/right arrows (or touch the left/right sides of the canvas)
          to move the robot.

        <p>This sketch is an interactive version of the printable artworks I made in my <a href="https://github.com/ptrgags/paper-toaster?tab=readme-ov-file#robot-walks-2024-06-10"><code>paper-toaster</code> project.</a>
          The Paper Toaster sketch is in turn inspired by <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=208">Project Euler #208: Robot Walks</a>.
          The goal is not to solve the original math puzzle about counting the possible paths, but just to visualize the patterns.
          </p>
        <p>
          The robot moves in arcs that are 1/5 of a circle. This angle does not create a regular grid like 1/4 or 1/6 turns would.
          Depending on the robot's path, sometimes you get satisfying squiggly patterns, other times you get a chaotic pile of overlapping arcs.
          If you're careful, you can get the robot to make an intricate loop, or patterns with 5-fold rotation symmetry like a flower.
        </p>
        <p>
          Art Challenge: Use the robot to draw a squiggly path around the canvas 
          without allowing the curve to cross itself. Try to fill as much of the negative space as you can!
          Here's an example I came up with:
