          This animation is a simulation of the pigmentation patterns on
          seashells, based on the 1992 SIGGRAPH paper,
          <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/shells.sig92.pdf"
            ><cite>Modeling Seashells</cite></a
          >
          by Fowler, Meinhardt and Prusinkiewicz.

          In particular, this triangle-looking pattern is a model for the shell
          of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliva_porphyria"
            ><i>Olivia Poryphia</i></a
          >, a.k.a. tent olive sea snail. Interestingly, this pattern can also
          be created via

          The paper linked above describes a reaction-diffusion system in one
          dimension for how activator and inhibitor hormones move across the
          shell's edge. The shell is growing only at the edge, everything else
          is just a history of past growth, similar to a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_photography"
            >slit scan animation</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this slit-scan interpretation in mind, we can examine the motion
          of the darker pigment:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The tips of triangles pointing up are events where the chemical
            reactions produce new pigment.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sides of triangles pointing upwards show the pigment spreading
            out horizontally.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sides of triangles pointing downwards represent two waves of
            pigment heading towards each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            The tips of triangles pointing downwards are events where pigments
            collide. The chemical reaction causes these to cancel out and you
            get the lighter color afterwards.
          </li>
