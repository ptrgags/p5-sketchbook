        <p>
          I want to port some of the things I did in
          <a href="https://github.com/ptrgags/math-notebook/tree/main"
            >math-notebook</a
          >
          to p5 so I can animate them. Except this time, I want to try using 2D
          Conformal Geometric Algebra (2D CGA) rather than complex numbers.
          There's a lot of moving pieces (see
          <a href="https://github.com/ptrgags/p5-sketchbook/issues/217"
            >the GitHubIssue</a
          >). So far this is just a test of rendering the geometry primitives. A
          Cline is a generalized circle or line. It does also have the corner
          case of a circle of radius zero (aka a null point in CGA).
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, this sketch creates and renders Cline objects. I also started
          implementing the key math operations such as geometric product and
          sandwich product. Here, I'm using this math to take the original
          clines (yellow shapes) and transform them. The blue shapes are the
          original ones flipped over the yellow line. The orange shapes are the
          original ones under circle inversion in the yellow circle.
