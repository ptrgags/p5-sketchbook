          I want to port some of the things I did in
          <a href="https://github.com/ptrgags/math-notebook/tree/main"
            >math-notebook</a
          >
          to p5 so I can animate them. Except this time, I want to try using 2D
          Conformal Geometric Algebra (2D CGA) rather than complex numbers.
          There's a lot of moving pieces (see
          <a href="https://github.com/ptrgags/p5-sketchbook/issues/217"
            >the GitHubIssue</a
          >). So far this is just a test of rendering the geometry primitives. A
          Cline is a generalized circle or line. Points are encoded as null
          points (circles with radius 0).
        </p>
        <p>
          This sketch creates some Cline and NullPoint objects and transforms
          them with versors. The original shapes are in yellow. The blue shapes
          are the originals flipped over the yellow line. The orange shapes are
          the originals inverted in the yellow circle. The green animated shapes
          are the originals rotated around the enter of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Update 2026-02-27: I added support for the different kinds of Möbius
          transformations, which allow me to do some fancy non-linear motions.
          For now, this page just demonstrates that each is working correctly.
