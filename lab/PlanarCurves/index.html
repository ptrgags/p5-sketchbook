            The RingBuffer from DoublePendulum/DoubleSpring will be handy for
            keeping track of the trails

            Do I want to arrange the curves evenly around a circle for more
            symmetry, or keep them randomly spaced like this?
          </li>
          <li>
            If the curves goes off screen, consider adjusting the curvature in a
            way so the curve will return to the screen (with a random walk,
            there's no guarantee it'll come back)

            This sketch has some unused code related to gamepads and MIDI (which
            inspired similar details in WebGPU sketchbook)... I need to think
            about whether I want to clean that up and add to sketchlib or remove
            it completely.
