        Notes:
        <ul>
          <li>
            UPDATE 2025-04-09 - I tried the idea of stacking springs
            side-by-side. It looks like my choice of initial conditions aren't
            actually producing chaotic behavior (It does however produce a
            pretty graph!). That said, even a double pendulum has regions that
            are more stable than others, see
            <a href="https://youtu.be/n7JK4Ht8k8M?si=90l4qSCRF5SY0ccu"
              >this video</a
            >. it might be worth making a plot like that of position 2 vs
            position 1 rather than this phase plot (velocity vs position).

            be similar to what was used on that page to link to this one.

            <a href="https://youtu.be/GoOVCgcw65M">the YouTube video </a> I made
            from my original version
          </li>
          <li>Color the springs with two values to give it a sense of depth</li>
          <li>Pick a color theme</li>
          <li>
            Document the equations of motion in a README file and link to it
            here
          </li>
          <li>Add a diagram of the forces</li>
          <li>
            What kinds of visualization(s) do I want to make with this?
            <ul>
              <li>
                Several copies of the spring system side-by-side with slightly
                different initial state to better show the chaotic nature?
              </li>
              <li>
                Interactively pull the end of the spring to set the start
                position?
              </li>
              <li>
                Separate the phase plots and put them next to each spring's rest
                position?
              </li>
              <li>Visualize the positions and velocities as vectors?</li>
            </ul>
