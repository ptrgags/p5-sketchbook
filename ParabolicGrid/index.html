          are the generalization of translations in conformal (angle-preserving)
          geometry. There's a single pole, acting as both a source and a sink.
          Points are repelled from one side, move along generalized circles and
          are attracted to the other side.

          In the animation above, I make use of two parabolic transformations.
          The motion of the purple circles is analagous to translation in the x
          direction. The motion of the green circles is analagous to translation
          along the y-direction.

          This sketch is continuing what I was doing in another repo,
          <a href="https://github.com/ptrgags/math-notebook"
            ><code>math-notebook</code></a
          >, except this time, it's animated! I also am using
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_geometric_algebra"
            >Conformal Geometric Algebra</a
          >
          for the math instead of using complex numbers. The results on the
          screen are equivalent; the only difference is how the shapes and
          transformations are represented in the math/code.
