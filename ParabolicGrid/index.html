          Parabolic Möbius transformations are the generalization of
          translations in conformal geometry. There's a single pole, acting as
          both a source and a sink. Points are repelled from one side, move
          along generalized circles and are attracted to the other side.

          If you've ever seen diagrams of the field lines around an ideal

            >electric dipole</a
          >, it's quite similar, though here the motion is along perfect
          circles.

          In the animation above, I make use of two parabolic transformations.
          The motion of the red circles is analagous to translation in the
          x-direction. The motion of the blue circles is analagous to
          translation along the y-direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is this related to translation? Consider a regular translation in
          the x-direction. It moves points away from infinity on the left, and
          towards infinity on the right. In conformal geometry, there's no +/-
          infinity, just a single point at infinity (See e.g. a description of
          the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere"
            >Riemann Sphere</a
          >
          from complex analysis). So this point at infinity is acting both as a
          source and a sink. It's the same thing, it just looks different in the
          projected view.
