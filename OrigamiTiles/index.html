          This sketch makes a continuous pattern from connecting many triangular
          tiles. If this pattern were printed out (double-sided) and folded on
          the light grey lines in either direction, no matter how you fold it,
          it produces a seamless tiling!
        </p>
        <p>
          To make this happen, I designed the tiles carefully so they have
          exactly the same pattern of dark and light parts on the boundary. For
          example, compare the following two tiles and see how the edges look
          the same even though the interior is very different.
        </p>
        <img
          alt="one of the image tiles"
          class="example-tile"
          src="tiles/triangle-tile1.svg"
        />
        <img
          alt="another one of the image tiles for comparison"
          class="example-tile"
          src="tiles/triangle-tile2.svg"
        />
        <p>
          Also notice how whever the curves meet the boundary of the triangle,
          the curve and the triangle edge are always perpendicular. This is the
          easiest way to make sure the curve doesn't suddenly bend when it moves
          into the neighboring tile.

          For the mathematically inclined, this means the patterns are
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness"

          >, not just C<sup>0</sup>
          continuous.
