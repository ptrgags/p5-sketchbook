          This sketch is an artistic combination of the

          and the substitution tiling in
          <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=405"
            >Project Euler problem #405</a
          >. Due to the colored crosses messing with the contrast, the pattern
          appears wavy when it actually isn't.

          Unfortunately, the pattern is a little bigger than the canvas. I use a
          specific image size of 500x700 px because it makes a consistent image
          size for my website. However, due to the substitution tiling, this
          pattern only looks right for power-of-two sizes. 256x512 is too small
          to make a nice image. 512x1024 is too big, but not too bad. So here we
          are.
