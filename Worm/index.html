          A while ago, I came across a fun animation technique from
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlfh_rv6khY&ab_channel=argonaut"
            >This YouTube video by user argonaut</a
          >. You start with a chain of joints. There are simple constraints on
          how to update the positions, starting on one end of the chain and
          working towards the other. While not a realistic simulation, this
          method is relatively simple to implement and has a fun cartoon
          creature vibe. There are two main constraints in use here:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Each joint follows a fixed distance behind the previous one. This
            causes the head of the worm to drag along the rest of the body.
          </li>
          <li>
            The angle between any 3 consecutive joints must be at least a
            minimum size. This prevents the curve from getting too pinched, and
            also creates S-bends like a snake.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I didn't implement any self-collision detection, so the worm can go
          through itself. This is not realistic, but it's amusing to create
          loops and watch as they unwind once they reach the tail.
